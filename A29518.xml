            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Namely ſpirit of Vitriel or Sulpher, in which you muſt dip a little ſtick &amp; rub the teeth with the end thereof, and then wipe them with a rag; in great foulneſſe uſe the oyles themſelves, otherwiſe you muſt mix them with honey of Roſes and faire water, leſt by the often uſe of them the gums ſhould be corroded. Afterwards the teeth being made white, to prevent their blackneſſe againe, and preſerve them white. Firſt, cleanſe them with a ſtick of Roſemary beaten at one end as a ſtick of Liquorice, and bruſh of the filth that hang on the teeth, then waſh the mouth with wine, and rub them with this powder, Take roots of Snakeweed, Allum, and white Currel, <hi>ana</hi> ℥ 1. make of them a powder to rub the teeth.</p>

            <p>It is a yellow colour of the whole body, coming of choller, ſpred on the skin.

               <hi>Aſcites</hi> is a ſwetting of the belly, cauſes of a ſerous humor, and not only of the belly but alſo of the feet leggs thighs and cods, ſometimes it begin with a ſwelling of the feet which aſcends afterwards to the leggs and to the thighs and cods. This humor as it is of the nature of water it is cold, but as it is ſalt, it hath in it heate, and is increaſed by the neerneſſe of the bowels, and more by the putrifaction which it gathereth by its long continuance, from whence comes a feavour and thirſt, from the ſtinking ſalt

            <p>The Dropſie called <hi>Timpanites,</hi> has his name from <hi>Timpanum</hi> a Drumb, becauſe the abdomen is ſtretched out like a Drumb, and if you ſtrike it, it ſounds like it, and this ſtretching comes from wind ſhut up in the cavety of the abdomen, and ſometimes in the cavety of the guts.

            <p>The Dropſie called <hi>Anaſarca</hi> comes of a flegmatick humor, ſpread through the whole body, and therefore the body is ſwoln and white, this flegm comes from a cold Liver, which inſtead of good blood, produceth cold and fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is an evil habit of body proceeding from the obſtruction of the veines of the Liver, Spleen, and Meſentery, eſpecially of thoſe veins which are about the womb, and the cauſe of the obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the veines of the womb and other parts, are thick ſlimy &amp; curdy humors coming from evil diet, by drinking Vinegar, eating Hearbs and unripe fruite, Chalk, Oatmeale, Nutmeg, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for hence it is that naturall heat is impaired and cruid humors increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>The Cure is, by opening the obſtructions, by evacuating of the filthy humors from out the whole body, and correcting the diſtemper of the bowels and ſtrengthning them. The obſtructions are taken away by theſe pills. Take of Steel prepared with brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone ℥ ſs. Alloes, Senna, Agarick <hi>ana</hi>

After bleeding take one purge more, after that make this Bath following to open and looſen the veſſels and to diſſolve and digeſt the matter cauſing obſtructions. Take Marſh mallow-roots, Lilly-roots, Elicompane, Bryony, wild Cucumer, <hi>ana</hi>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45200:22"/> the tearmes uſe to flow. After the obſtructions are opened, you muſt diſcuſſe the flegm like ſerous humors that remaine in the veines by ſwets, uſe the decoction of <hi>Guajacum</hi> in cold conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in hot, the decoction of Chyna and Sarſa for 15 or 20 dayes, with this caution that every fourth or fifth day you give a purge to cleanſe the bowels of humors that cannot be ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There are many cauſes of this diſeaſe, but chiefly it proceeds from cold and thick humors.</p>

In quantity when it is too much or too little, too much when it ſtretcheth out the veines ſo that they cannot contract themſelves to expell it. Too little when the body hath not blood enough to nouriſh it. Blood offends in quallity when it is thick and ſlimy, by reaſon of the cold diſtemper of the Liver and other parts. It offends in motion when it paſſeth other wayes, as by the Noſe, Vomiting, Spitting, Urine, Hemorr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoids and the like.</p>
            <p>To the Cure,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> if it proceeds from too much blood, let blood in the armes, and abate the quantity of it, for if you ſhould firſt open the <hi>vena Saphena</hi> or lower veine, the blood would be drawn more to the womb and cauſe a greater obſtruction and diſtention of the veſſels, and break them, or cauſe inflamation of the womb After aboundance of blood is taken away, you muſt draw the blood down by opening the lower veines, about the time the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man uſe before to have her Tearmes.</p>
            <p>After theſe things uſe Baths, you need to follow no other rules then thoſe in the Cure of the Green-ſickneſſe, in order for gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the obſtructions of the bowels are opened, the courſes flow of their own accord.</p>

            <p>To the Cure,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> to draw blood from the part affected the Patient muſt bleed in the arm, as much as her ſtrength can beare, but not all at once but by degrees, now and then ſtopping the orifice with the finger, ſome uſe to faſten a large Cupping-glaſſe unto the dugs, to ſtop the courſes, and if ſhe grow ſhort breathed, they take it preſently off, I never uſed it, but after bleeding gave theſe pills.

            <p>The Cure<note place="margin">Cure.</note> of this diſeaſe is by a convenient purging of the Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant humor, and becauſe flegmatick and wheyiſh humors do moſt commonly abound, purge four times with this medicine.

There is no neceſſity of bleeding in this diſeaſe, after ſufficient purgations, procure ſwet to expell the remnants of the excrementious humor, and alſo to cauſe a further revultion of the humors falling into the womb, and for this purpoſe a decoction of <hi>Lignum Guajacum,</hi> and Saſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphras is excellent in cold bodyes, and in chollerick and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chollick bodyes the decoction of China and Sarſaparilla, with cooling hearbs leſt the humor ſhould be more exaſperated.

When oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is of injection, let it be with Barly water, or water ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Sugar, afterwards to dry and ſtrengthen the womb, uſe theſe fumes (of Franckinſcence Laudanum, Maſtick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sanders, Nutmeg, and red Roſe leaves) over a Cloſe-ſtoole.
